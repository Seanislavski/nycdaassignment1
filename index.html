			<h2>Why This is Such a <font color = "red">Great</font> Site</h2>
			<h3>and how I'm <font color="teal">super</font> humble about it (cuz I'm great too)</h3>
			<h4>by Sean Rivis</h4>
			<br>
			<p>
				This is probably the greatest site. Let me mansplain. In this world there are a few things that are sure. They are: 
				<ul>
					<li>Terrorism</li>
					<li>Bad-Assness</li>
					<li>Stuffed Mushrooms</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Let's not forget the importance of what I say here. It's super important. I am important. Don't argue. I'm not usually wrong, I'm usually right. I'm not being defensive.
				</p><p>	
					So let's get to dealing with it, cuz you're all upset and crying all the time. I just simply can't handle you crying so much. Please stop crying. Feelings!
				</p><p>
					I read an article the other day on Comic Sans and why it was so terrible. I truly didn't understand from a design point of view what was so stand-offish about the font. I found out through that site about this font, `Comic Neue`. I don't like it at all! Why is it so ugly? I can't tell. It is supposed to be more readable than Comic Sans though, so I suppose there's that!
